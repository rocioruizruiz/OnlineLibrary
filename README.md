## This is a program which consists on a library where you can search a book and book it or return it. Its internationally  adapted. You can also become an user if you are interested.
## The idea is to develope a private area for employees to manage their own data, such as  their salary.

## PROGRAM:

1. Search a book by its ISBN
2. Search a book by its title
3. Register a new user
4. Search user by ID
5. Library register
0. Exit

## I have implemented a heritage of employees, that manage their salary and their salary increase depending on their antiquity on the library.

## This program can also show a register of the movements that have been made on the library by users.

## CONCLUSION:

Doing this program I have learnt a lot of things related with java, including making tests, creating menus with different options, or how to internationalizate a program.
