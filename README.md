# Practicas
## This is a program based on a library where you can access as an employee or as an user. 

## PROGRAM:
  1. User:
    You can search, book or return a book.
      1. Search a book by its ISBN
      2. Search a book by its title
      3. Register a new user
      4. Search user by ID
      5. Library register (show all the movements made by users, and predict the return date of the books booked)
      0. Exit
  2. Employee:
    Is a private area for employees to manage their own data, such as  their salary.
    For the moment there are two jobs: librarian, and contable.
        The librarian manage de number of books a library need and make the orders.
        The contable is the responsible for paying the librarian's pending orders.

## This library is internationally adapted.

## I have implemented a heritage of employees to manage their salary and their salary increase depending on their antiquity on the library and their kind of job.


## CONCLUSION:

Doing this program I have learnt a lot of things related with java, including testing my program, creating menus with different options, or internationalize my program.
