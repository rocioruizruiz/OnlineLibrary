# Practicas
## This is a program based on a library where you can access as an employee or as an user. 

## PROGRAM:
1. User:
            You can search, book or return a book.
                        1. Search a book by its ISBN
                        2. Search a book by its title
                        3. Register a new user
                        4. Search user by ID
                        5. Library register (show all the movements made by users, and predict the return date of the books booked)
                        0. Exit
2. Employee:
            Is a private area for employees to manage their own data, such as  their salary.
            For the moment there are two jobs: librarian, and contable.
            The librarian manage de number of books a library need and make the orders.
            The contable is the responsible for paying the librarian's pending orders.

## This library is internationally adapted.
## It is connected to a database with 3 tables: books, users and employees.
## 

## I have implemented a heritage of employees to manage their salary and their salary increase depending on their antiquity on the library and their kind of job.
## An interface has also been implemented for searching
In this moment there are some interfaces of the application that are useless because there are some functions that need a reformulation due to some updates in the rest of the app. In consequence, we are refactoring the code to be able to give the users all the functionality in a short period time.

## CONCLUSION:

Doing this program I have learnt a lot of things related with java, including testing my program, creating menus with different options, or internationalize my program. I also have learnt to use Sonar Lint, which is a programm that indicates you ways of optimizating your code.
